  "readme": "# queue.js\n\n**Queue.js** is yet another asynchronous helper library for JavaScript. Think of it as a minimalist version of [Async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) that allows fine-tuning over parallelism. Or, think of it as a version of [TameJs](http://tamejs.org/) that does not use code generation.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to stat two files in parallel:\n\n```js\nqueue()\n    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + \"/../Makefile\")\n    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + \"/../package.json\")\n    .await(function(error, file1, file2) { console.log(file1, file2); });\n```\n\nOr, if you wanted to run a bazillion asynchronous tasks (here represented as an array of closures) serially:\n\n```js\nvar q = queue(1);\ntasks.forEach(function(t) { q.defer(t); });\nq.awaitAll(function(error, results) { console.log(\"all done!\"); });\n```\n\nQueue.js can be run inside Node.js or in a browser.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn a browser, you can use the official hosted copy on [d3js.org](http://d3js.org):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"http://d3js.org/queue.v1.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nQueue.js supports the asynchronous module definition (AMD) API. For example, if you use [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), you may load as follows:\n\n```js\nrequire.config({paths: {queue: \"http://d3js.org/queue.v1.min\"}});\n\nrequire([\"queue\"], function(queue) {\n  console.log(queue.version);\n});\n```\n\nIn Node, use [NPM](http://npmjs.org) to install:\n\n```bash\nnpm install queue-async\n```\n\nAnd then `require(\"queue-async\")`. (The package name is [queue-async](https://npmjs.org/package/queue-async) because the name “queue” was already taken.)\n\n## API Reference\n\n### queue([parallelism])\n\nConstructs a new queue with the specified *parallelism*. If *parallelism* is not specified, the queue has infinite parallelism. Otherwise, *parallelism* is a positive integer. For example, if *parallelism* is 1, then all tasks will be run in series. If *parallelism* is 3, then at most three tasks will be allowed to proceed concurrently; this is useful, for example, when loading resources in a web browser.\n\n### queue.defer(task[, arguments…])\n\nAdds the specified asynchronous *task* function to the queue, with any optional *arguments*. The *task* will be called with the optional arguments and an additional callback argument; the callback should be invoked when the task has finished. Tasks can only be deferred before the *await* callback is set. If a task is deferred after the await callback is set, the behavior of the queue is undefined.\n\n### queue.await(callback)\n### queue.awaitAll(callback)\n\nSets the *callback* to be invoked when all deferred tasks have finished. The first argument to the *callback* is the first error that occurred, or null if no error occurred. If *await* is used, each result is passed as an additional separate argument; if *awaitAll* is used, the entire array of results is passed as the second argument to the callback. If all callbacks have already been completed by the time the *await* or *awaitAll* callback is set, the callback will be invoked immediately. This method should only be called once, after any tasks have been deferred. If the await callback is set multiple times, or set before a task is deferred, the behavior of the queue is undefined.\n\n## Callbacks\n\nThe callbacks follow the Node.js convention where the first argument is an optional error object and the second argument is the result of the task. Queue.js does not support asynchronous functions that return multiple results; however, you can homogenize such functions by wrapping them and converting multiple results into a single object or array.\n",
