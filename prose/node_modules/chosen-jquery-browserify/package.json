  "readme": "# Chosen\n\nChosen is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more user friendly. This is a fork of the original Chosen plugin. This plugin bundles its own version of jquery and makes the chosen plugin sutiable for requiring in projects that use browserify.\n\n- jQuery support: 1.4+\n\nFor documentation, usage, and examples, see:  \nhttp://harvesthq.github.com/chosen\n\n### Contributing to Chosen\n\nContributions and pull requests are very welcome. Please follow these guidelines when submitting new code.\n\n1. Make all changes in Coffeescript files, **not** JavaScript files.\n2. For feature changes, update both jQuery *and* Prototype versions\n3. Use `npm install -d` to install the correct development dependencies.\n4. Use `grunt` to generate Chosen's JavaScript file and minified version.\n5. Don't touch the `VERSION` file\n6. Submit a Pull Request using GitHub.\n\n### Using CoffeeScript & Cake\n\nFirst, make sure you have the proper CoffeeScript set-up in place. We have added a package.json that makes this easy:\n\n```\nnpm install -d\n```\n\nThis will install all the development dependencies.\n\nOnce you're configured, building the JavasScript from the command line is easy:\n\n    grunt\n    \n### Chosen Credits\n\n- Built by [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/).
